# BYDFi Referral Code: dwPtzS = Bonuses + Lower Fee


**The crypto trading space is saturated with platforms promising bonuses, but very few actually deliver consistent value and ease of use. After testing dozens of exchanges, BYDFi stood out — not just for its sleek interface and high leverage options, but for its real, achievable rewards for new users**.

In this article, I’ll share my honest experience with BYDFi, and how you can unlock up to $8,100 in bonuses and cut your trading fees in half using the referral code **dwPtzS**.
